  "summary": "New grad (MS CS, UC Santa Cruz, March 2026) focused on backend systems, AI infrastructure, and networking. Built Saturn, a zero-configuration AI service discovery framework across 11 languages with published packages on npm and PyPI. Strong teaching background (161 students, 87.5% satisfaction). Honest about gaps: no production-at-scale experience, no oncall, limited cloud infrastructure.",
