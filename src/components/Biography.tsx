          I grew up and lived in Turlock, CA until I graduated from the local
          college:{" "}
          <a href="https://www.csustan.edu/" target="_blank">
            CSU Stanislaus.
          </a>{" "}
          I began studying computer science and coded for the first time at
          Modesto Junior College during COVID lockdowns. At this time, I took
          beginner CS courses and college electives that fulfilled graduation
          requirements: Shakespeare, Astronomy, and People and Culture of the
          Amazon, to name a few. I worked at Togo&apos;s Sandwiches at the time
          and struggled to find purpose in computer science.

          Fortunately, I found a great support system at CSU Stanislaus. My
          family and friends always supported me through my journey and provided
          a great foundation for me. Jerry, Kevin, Luis, and all my coworkers
          made working for{" "}

          such a great experience. I specifically look back fondly on filming
          graduation ceremonies and running around fixing tech in classrooms with
          them.{" "}

          is one of the best professors and mentors I have ever had, and she is
          one of the most influential figures in my academic journey. She
          mentored me through CSU Stan&apos;s{" "}

          program. She helped motivate me to stay in computer science, wrote my
          letter of recommendation to UCSC, and was probably the main reason I
          was admitted (along with my CV letter, thanks for the help, Dad). A lot
          of people in California like to hate on CSU Stanislaus, but the
          experiences and mentors I had there changed my life forever.

          I bent the truth slightly in my last paragraph. Twice during my
          undergrad, I lived outside of Turlock. The first time was when I
          studied abroad in London for my internship, which can be found on the{" "}
          <a href="#experience">work experience</a> section. My program lasted
          two months, and living in a major metropolitan city changed my life.
          All the friends I made and experiences I had (both lists are too long to
          include) offered me such powerful introspection. This trip made me more
          confident and focused on my career goals. The second time was my final
          semester of undergrad, when I slept on my brother&apos;s couch in
          Monterey, California while driving back to Turlock for classes. I used
          this time to reflect on who I wanted to become. I studied 3D art
          creation with{" "}

            Blender
          </a>{" "}
          and video editing with{" "}

          . I also ground out a lot of{" "}

          </a>{" "}
          at the time, much like my fellow computer science graduates. To pay the
          bills, I worked at the best kayak tour shop in America:{" "}
          <a href="https://kayakconnection.com/" target="_blank">
            Kayak Connection
          </a>{" "}
          in Elkhorn Slough. They have the highest population of northern sea
          otters and offer incredible wildlife tours, tell them I sent you. I
          bring up these two experiences because both of them gave me time to
          realize that I was unsatisfied with what I had accomplished in
          academia. Fortunately, I was blessed when I saw that my application got
          accepted to the University of California, Santa Cruz.

          is so many different things to me that it is hard to explain the impact
          it has had on my life. From completely altering the trajectory of my
          career to strengthening my basketball dominance in recreational
          classes, UCSC has changed my life. I began my first quarter taking
          Network Security with{" "}
          <a href="https://ramakrishnansr.com/" target="_blank">
            Ram Raman
          </a>
          , which blew me away. I learned so much about modern research in DNS,
          technology like ZMap, and censorship resistance. I thought I would
          continue down the security road until I took Interactive Storytelling
          with Michael Mateas, the creator of{" "}
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa%C3%A7ade_(video_game)"

          >
            Fa&ccedil;ade
          </a>
          ! This class pushed me into the realm of game AI and generated content,
          which is when Mateas recommended I take &ldquo;Teaching with Generative
          AI&rdquo; with{" "}
          <a href="https://adamsmith.as/" target="_blank">
            Adam Smith
          </a>
          , who ended up becoming my research advisor and the most influential
          figure in my academic journey. I am writing this as I am building{" "}

          with him, and already my way of thinking, solving problems, and asking
          questions has become so much stronger. I am a better engineer now, and
          I have the confidence and experience to build great technology.

          I left out so much more that I could include in this biography, but I
          wanted to keep it short. I am always learning and growing, but I am
          someone who finishes their goals and constantly sets the bar higher. I
          want to be an inspiration to computer scientists who feel stuck and
          lost. I want to push myself to limits I don&apos;t know exist yet. But
          still, I am new. I am looking for my next big experience after grad
          school, and I hope to find a company or startup that aligns with my
          goals of creating AI tools to boost productivity and quality of life
          for people. If you would like to talk to me to learn more, I respond to
          emails and Twitter messages the fastest, but you can find all my
          socials below. Thank you for taking the time to read, and if you made
          it this far shoot me a message!
